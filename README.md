### What's Interesting:
This article talks about the development and evolution of software engineering from the mid 1900s to today. What I find intersting is how the authors start by comparing the main principles of early software engineering to methodologies of philosopher Hegel. Hegel breaks these principles down into three basic steps: thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. For instance, the original thesis about software engineering in the 1950s was that it can simply be broken down into parts, like hardware. But decades later, it's antithesis was developed and noted that software engineering is much more than just hardware and machinery. The rest of the article highlights the step of synthesis, talking about how software engineering progressed throughout the decades: it's ideologies evolved from black/white thinking to more theoretical and adaptable thinking. Software engineering is forever changing and growing, so the way we learn about and utilize software engineering must grow and adapt with it.


### Finn Eskeland Response:

Wow! I think it is so interesting to examine the history of sofware engineering and computer science. Especially in today's CS climate, things are changing so fast and it feels like the golden age of new tech. It's cool to look back and see how much the ideas of how to engineer software have been shaped, and I am curious about the future. I think we are at a point in time where things will change even more, developers will use AI tools and be able to reach new heights, and the way we think about solving problems will problably be different as well.
